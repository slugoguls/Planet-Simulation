üåç Planetary Simulation using C++ & OpenGL
A real-time, interactive 3D simulation that visualizes gravitational interactions between celestial bodies. Built with C++, OpenGL, and GLM, this project offers a physics-accurate and scalable system for simulating planetary motion using Newtonian mechanics.

üß† Project Overview
This simulation models gravitational attraction between multiple planets in 3D space. It calculates the net gravitational force on each planet based on the masses and distances of all other planets and updates their velocity and position accordingly. All rendering is handled using OpenGL, with support from GLFW for window/context management and GLM for math operations.
